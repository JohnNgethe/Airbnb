## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

- What REST means
- What API means
- What CORS means
- What is an API
- What is a REST API
- What are other types of APIs
- Which is the HTTP method to retrieve resource(s)
- Which is the HTTP method to create a resource
- Which is the HTTP method to update a resource
- Which is the HTTP method to delete a resource
- How to request a REST API

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start with test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
